ðŸš€ Career Transition and Studying C# ðŸ’»
Currently, I'm in the midst of a career transition, focusing my efforts on becoming a C# developer. I'm a tech enthusiast with initial experience in web and mobile development, and now I'm diving headfirst into the world of C# to expand my skills and explore new opportunities in the job market.

ðŸŒŸ About Me
Junior Web Developer with experience in mobile development.

After a 6-month break from web development studies, I'm resuming my learning journey with a focus on C#, .NET MAUI, and other relevant technologies.

I'm passionate about technology and innovation, always striving to stay updated with the latest tools and practices.

Beyond web and mobile development, I have a strong interest in Unreal Engine and game development, areas I plan to integrate with my new C# skills.

ðŸ’» Technologies and Tools
Here are some of the technologies I've worked with:

Web Development: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Mobile Development: Kotlin, Flutter, Dart, .NET MAUI

Game Development: Unreal Engine

New Focus: C#, .NET MAUI, Unity (currently studying)

ðŸ“š What I'm Currently Studying
C#: Learning the language for desktop, web (ASP.NET), and game development (Unity).

.NET MAUI: Exploring cross-platform mobile app development with .NET.

Flutter & Dart: Continuing to improve my skills in Flutter for building beautiful and responsive mobile apps.

Kotlin: Enhancing my knowledge of native Android development.

Unreal Engine: Advancing my skills in game development.

ðŸŽ® Big Dream
My long-term goal is to combine my skills in web, mobile, and C# with game development, creating innovative projects that leave a mark in the world of technology and gaming. I aim to leverage .NET MAUI for cross-platform mobile apps and Unity for game development, while continuing to explore Flutter and Kotlin for mobile solutions.

ðŸš€ Let's Connect!
If you share the same enthusiasm for technology, innovation, and software development, or if you have an opportunity that could help me in this career transition journey, let's talk! I'm always open to new connections and collaborations.

Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€
